# Evaluation

When we evaluate models, we will need a loss function and our goal is to minimize the expected loss value.

The reason for it to be _expected_ loss is because our loss is always going to be computed over a sample of data points. So in the 
probabilitic sense, the loss is associated with an actual distribution.

## Conditional Risk Minimization

The conditional risk is defined as:

$$ \textbf{E}[L(y,\hat{y})] = \sum_y L(y,\hat{y})P(Y=y|X=x) $$
