# Neural Differential Equations

Neural Differential Equations [@NEURIPS2018_69386f6b] were a family of deep neural network models proposed 
in 2018 as the infintely continuous variant of a discrete recurrent neural network. One of the major applications
of such type of models was in time series data. Time Series are often directly modeled in terms of differential 
equations. In this article, we will explore the literature thats developed since the introduction of Neural
ODES in 2018.
