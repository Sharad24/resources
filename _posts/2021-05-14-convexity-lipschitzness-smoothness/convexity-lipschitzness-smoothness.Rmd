### Theorem

A function $f : I \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ over some set $I \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is called Lipschitz-continuous
if there exists some $L \geq 0$ such that 

$$
|f(x)\ -\ f(y)| \leq L (x\ -\ y)
$$

where, $x,\ y\ \epsilon\ I$


If such a constant $L$ exists, then we call $L$ as the Lipschitz Constant of $f$ over $I$.

Equivalently, $f$ is Lipschitz continuous is there exists $L \geq 0$ such that 

$$
\frac{|f(x)\ -\ f(y)|}{x\ -\ y} \leq L
$$

where, $x,\ y\ \epsilon\ I,\ x\ \neq\ y$

### Lemma

A function $f\ :\ I\ \rightarrow \ \mathbb{R}$ is Lipschitz-continuous with Lipschitz-constant $L$ if and only if 
$$
f(x)\ -\ L |x\ -\ y|\ \leq \ f(y) \ \leq \ f(x) \ + \ L |x\ -\ y|
$$

#### Proof

If $f$ if Lipschitz-constinuous with constant $L$ then,

$$
|f(x)\ -\ f(y)| \leq L (x\ -\ y)
$$

On resolving the modulus we can get two equations. 

The first one, $$f(x)\ -\ f(y) \leq L (x\ -\ y)$$
which equivalently is $$f(x)\ -\ L |x\ -\ y|\ \leq \ f(y)$$

and the second one, $$f(y)\ -\ f(x) \leq L (x\ -\ y)$$
which is $$f(y)\ \leq \ f(x) +\ L |x\ -\ y|$$
