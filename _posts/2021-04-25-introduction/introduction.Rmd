#### What is learning theory?

The goal of learning theory is to be able to develop formal models to analyse complexity of learning systems.
Such as:

  * How much data do we need to learn? 
  * How much computational resources are necessary for learning?
  * Are there any hard problems?

Computational Learning theory also helps us in answerning burning questions in modern machine learning, such as:

  * How can we learn in the presence of noisy data?
  * What can we learn when data is obtained in an online manner?
  * How can we do useful machine learning when the data is noisy?
  * Can we learn when data and computational power is distributed?
